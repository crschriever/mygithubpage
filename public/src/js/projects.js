			<p>Cicerone is an android app that tells you about any interesting location you happen to pass by, whether you're walking, driving, or flying. The core idea is to let the user explore while the application highlights what is nearby. It will automatically detect nearby interesting locations and tell you about them using text-to-speech even if the app is in the background or your phone is closed. Go into silent mode and receive push notifications instead of voice.</p>
			<p>Cicerone is built for Android, making use of Java, Google Maps API, and mobile text-to-speech. The app itself makes use of map data and wiki information in order to describe locations in a way the user will understand.</p>

            "<p>Gate Keeper is a project my team made at HackGSU. We wanted to make an easy, secure way for people to grant access to buildings and alleviate having to check in at the front desk everywhere you go.</p>" +
            "<p>This solution provides a robust admin side database system to manage access based on asymmetric elliptic curve encryption to authentic access requests. Additionally, we built an intuitive client side app to make it easy to interface with the database side through NFC to easily gain access. Also, we wanted to make sure everything was secure, so we used private keys generated on the users' devices to sign access requests, which are checked against a server side database of approved credentials. Finally, for added security, we designed the system to be able to work over LAN to allow clients to run the solution on an air-gapped system for extra security.</p>" +
